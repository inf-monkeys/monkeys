## Getting Started

### üë®‚Äçüíª Developer

#### Prerequisites

- [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current): This project requires node version at least 18.
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/): We use yarn as the Node Package Manager.
- [Conductor](https://github.com/inf-monkeys/conductor)(Optional): Conductor is a workflow orchestration engine, we recommand use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) to run Conductor, with one command bellow:

  ```bash
  docker pull infmonkeys/conductor:1.0.0

  docker run --name conductor -p 8080:8080 -d infmonkeys/conductor:1.0.0
  ```

  You can verify whether conductor running corrctly by use the following command:

  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:8080/api
  ```

  If show something like this, it's working fine:

  ```
  {"timestamp":"2024-03-21T10:29:36.635+00:00","status":404,"error":"Not Found","path":"/api"}
  ```

  > If you do not install conductor, you won't be able to use the Workflow feature, but others still works fine.

- [Redis](https://redis.io/)(Optional): We use inmemory cache as default, for test purpose, you can just skip this.
- Postgres/MySQL(Optional): We use sqlite as default storage engine, for test purpose, you can just skip this.


#### Backend

2. Go to `monkeys` folder

   ```sh
   cd monkeys
   ```

3. Install Node Modules
   ```sh

4. Run the server:

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

#### Frontend 

1. Go to `ui` folder

   ```sh
